# Simple Game in .NET:

## First features implemented:
- Implemented GAME OVER display with REPLAY button when the player collides with an exploding bomb 
- Changed the tileset and added multiple layers (grass, trees, rocks, plants) 
- Added player collision with the objects (trees, rocks, plants) on the different layers on the map 
- Added player collision with the bomb

## Last features implemented:
- Added a second player, a friend, with the same abilities as a normal player (collision with the map layers and the bomb), that gets randomly spawned on the map.  
- He stays still until the player meets him and, after that, they walk together across the map, running from the bombs. 
- If the bomb hits either of the players, the game is over and you can replay it.
